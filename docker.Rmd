## Create Config files

**Dockerfile**

```{bash}
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:2.7-slim

# Set the working directory to /app
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
ADD . /app

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --trusted-host pypi.python.org -r requirements.txt

# Make port 80 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 80

# Define environment variable
ENV NAME World

# Run app.py when the container launches
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

**requirements.txt**

```{bash}
printf "Flask\nRedis" > requirements.txt
```

**app.py**

```{python eval=FALSE}
from flask import Flask
from redis import Redis, RedisError
import os
import socket

# Connect to Redis
redis = Redis(host="redis", db=0, socket_connect_timeout=2, socket_timeout=2)

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello():
    try:
        visits = redis.incr("counter")
    except RedisError:
        visits = "<i>cannot connect to Redis, counter disabled</i>"

    html = "<h3>Hello {name}!</h3>" \
           "<b>Hostname:</b> {hostname}<br/>" \
           "<b>Visits:</b> {visits}"
    return html.format(name=os.getenv("NAME", "world"), hostname=socket.gethostname(), visits=visits)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=80)
```

## Build & Run

```{bash}
# Now run the build command. This creates a Docker image, which we’re going to tag using -t so it has a friendly name.
docker build -t friendlyhello .
# Where is your built image? It’s in your machine’s local Docker image registry:
docker image ls
# Run the app, mapping your machine’s port 4000 to the container’s published port 80 using -p:
docker run -p 4000:80 friendlyhello
```

Go to `http://localhost:4000` in a web browser to see the display content served up on a web page.

This port remapping of 4000:80 is to demonstrate the difference between what you EXPOSE within the Dockerfile, and what you publish using docker run -p. In later steps, we just map port 80 on the host to port 80 in the container and use http://localhost.

Hit CTRL+C in your terminal to quit.

Now let’s run the app in the background, in detached mode:

```{bash}
docker run -d -p 4000:80 friendlyhello
docker container ls
docker container stop 1fa4ab2cf395
```

## Share your image

A registry is a collection of repositories, and a repository is a collection of images—sort of like a GitHub repository, except the code is already built. An account on a registry can create many repositories. The docker CLI uses Docker’s public registry by default.

```{bash}
docker login
```

The notation for associating a local image with a repository on a registry is username/repository:tag. The tag is optional, but recommended, since it is the mechanism that registries use to give Docker images a version. Give the repository and tag meaningful names for the context, such as get-started:part2. This puts the image in the get-started repository and tag it as part2.

Now, put it all together to tag the image. Run docker tag image with your username, repository, and tag names so that the image uploads to your desired destination. The syntax of the command is:

```{bash}
docker tag image username/repository:tag
docker tag friendlyhello triamus/docker-get-started:part2
docker image ls
# Upload your tagged image to the repository:
docker push username/repository:tag
```

From now on, you can use docker run and run your app on any machine with this command:

```{bash}
docker run -p 4000:80 username/repository:tag
```

## Cheatsheet so far

```{bash}
docker build -t friendlyhello .  # Create image using this directory's Dockerfile
docker run -p 4000:80 friendlyhello  # Run "friendlyname" mapping port 4000 to 80
docker run -d -p 4000:80 friendlyhello         # Same thing, but in detached mode
docker container ls                                # List all running containers
docker container ls -a             # List all containers, even those not running
docker container stop <hash>           # Gracefully stop the specified container
docker container kill <hash>         # Force shutdown of the specified container
docker container rm <hash>        # Remove specified container from this machine
docker container rm $(docker container ls -a -q)         # Remove all containers
docker image ls -a                             # List all images on this machine
docker image rm <image id>            # Remove specified image from this machine
docker image rm $(docker image ls -a -q)   # Remove all images from this machine
docker login             # Log in this CLI session using your Docker credentials
docker tag <image> username/repository:tag  # Tag <image> for upload to registry
docker push username/repository:tag            # Upload tagged image to registry
docker run username/repository:tag                   # Run image from a registry
```

## Get Started, Part 3: Services

Install docker-compose.

```{bash}
sudo curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.21.1/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m) -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
# Apply executable permissions to the binary:
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
# test installation
docker-compose --version
```

**Your first docker-compose.yml file**

A `docker-compose.yml` file is a YAML file that defines how Docker containers should behave in production.

Save this file as docker-compose.yml wherever you want. Be sure you have pushed the image you created in Part 2 to a registry, and update this .yml by replacing username/repo:tag with your image details.

```
version: "3"
services:
  web:
    # replace username/repo:tag with your name and image details
    image: triamus/docker-get-started:part2
    deploy:
      replicas: 5
      resources:
        limits:
          cpus: "0.1"
          memory: 50M
      restart_policy:
        condition: on-failure
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    networks:
      - webnet
networks:
  webnet:
```

Before we can use the `docker stack deploy` command we first run:

```{bash}
docker swarm init
#> may result in error:
#Error response from daemon: could not choose an IP address to advertise since this system has multiple addresses on interface wlp4s0 (2001:16b8:469d:a800:c076:cc7d:7486:7cea and 2001:16b8:469d:a800:6b5d:1a54:9256:12c1) - specify one with --advertise-addr

# try using ifconfig to figure out physical address for wlp4s0, see
# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38602903/docker-swarm-init-could-not-choose-an-ip-address-error
docker swarm init --advertise-addr 192.168.178.57
```

Now let’s run it. You need to give your app a name. Here, it is set to getstartedlab:

```{bash}
docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml getstartedlab
```

Our single service stack is running 5 container instances of our deployed image on one host. Let’s investigate.

Get the service ID for the one service in our application:

```{bash}
docker service ls
```

A single container running in a service is called a task. Tasks are given unique IDs that numerically increment, up to the number of replicas you defined in docker-compose.yml. List the tasks for your service:

```{bash}
docker service ps getstartedlab_web
# Tasks also show up if you just list all the containers on your system, though that is not filtered by service:
docker container ls -q
```

You can run `curl -4 http://localhost` several times in a row, or go to that URL in your browser and hit refresh a few times. Either way, the container ID changes, demonstrating the load-balancing; with each request, one of the 5 tasks is chosen, in a round-robin fashion, to respond. The container IDs match your output from the previous command.

You can scale the app by changing the replicas value in docker-compose.yml, saving the change, and re-running the docker stack deploy command. Docker performs an in-place update, no need to tear the stack down first or kill any containers.

```{bash}
docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml getstartedlab
```

* Take the app down with `docker stack rm`
* Take down the swarm with docker `swarm leave --force`

```{bash}
docker stack rm getstartedlab
docker swarm leave --force
```

## Cheatsheet so far

```{bash}
docker stack ls                                            # List stacks or apps
docker stack deploy -c <composefile> <appname>  # Run the specified Compose file
docker service ls                 # List running services associated with an app
docker service ps <service>                  # List tasks associated with an app
docker inspect <task or container>                   # Inspect task or container
docker container ls -q                                      # List container IDs
docker stack rm <appname>                             # Tear down an application
docker swarm leave --force      # Take down a single node swarm from the manager
```
